A to-do list is a simple organizational tool used to track tasks and manage daily activities. It consists of a list of tasks that need to be completed, often accompanied by checkboxes to mark tasks as done. To create a basic to-do list using HTML and CSS:

HTML Structure:
Start with an HTML file and create an unordered list to hold the tasks. Inside the list, add list items for each task. Use checkboxes (<input type="checkbox">) within the list items to mark tasks as completed.

CSS Styling:
Apply CSS to style the to-do list. Use CSS properties like margin, padding, border, and background-color to enhance the appearance of the list and checkboxes. You can use CSS classes to target specific elements for styling.

Layout and Design:
Use CSS to control the layout and design of the list. You can adjust the spacing, alignment, and colors to match your desired aesthetic. Apply hover effects or animations to improve user interaction.

Responsive Design:
Implement responsive design by using CSS media queries. Ensure that your to-do list looks and functions well on different screen sizes, such as desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
